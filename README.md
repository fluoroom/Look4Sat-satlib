# Look4Sat: Satellite tracker

[![Look4Sat CI](https://github.com/fluoroom/Look4Sat-satlib/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fluoroom/Look4Sat-satlib/actions/workflows/release.yml)

### [SatLib](https://github.com/fluoroom/satlib) fork, for using with [N76-satlib-android](https://github.com/fluoroom/n76bt-satlib-android) and others.

### !!! This fork must be downloaded from [releases page](https://github.com/fluoroom/Look4Sat-satlib/releases), NOT app stores, until (maybe) the main Look4Sat project adopts these changes.

### Track satellite passes with ease!

Thanks to [Celestrak](https://celestrak.com/) and [SatNOGS](https://satnogs.org/) you have access to over 9000 active satellites.\
You can search the entire database by NORAD Catalog Number or the satellite's name.

Orbital positions and passes are calculated relative to your location.\
To get reliable data make sure to set the station position via the app Settings.

The application is built using Kotlin, Coroutines, Jetpack Compose and Navigation.\
It is now and always will be completely ad-free and open-source.

## Main features:

*  Predicting satellite positions and passes for up to 10 days
*  Showing the list of currently active and upcoming satellite passes
*  Showing the active pass progress, polar trajectory and transceivers info
*  Showing the satellite positional data, footprint and ground track on the map
*  Custom TLE satellite data import is available via Three Line Element .txt files
*  Offline first: calculations are made offline. Weekly TLE data update is recommended.

## This fork

This fork adds **satlib** and several quality-of-life improvements on top of upstream Look4Sat.

### Transponder filters applied to the radar screen

The mode and band filters set in the passes screen (e.g. FM, V/U) are now also applied to the transponder list shown on the radar screen. Only transceivers that match the active filter are displayed, keeping the list focused on what you actually care about.

### SSTV audio input selection

The SSTV decoder lets you choose the audio input source: **Microphone** (default) or **Unprocessed** (raw ADC, bypasses noise suppression). Select from the button in the SSTV control bar before starting a recording.

### [satlib](https://github.com/fluoroom/satlib)

satlib is a universal local-network API that exposes complete, real-time satellite pass data so any external application can consume it over HTTP, without device-specific integrations inside the tracker.

satlib data is published only while the **Track** toggle is active on the radar screen. Selecting a transponder alone does not trigger updates — tracking must be explicitly enabled.

While tracking is active, any device on the same network can poll:

```
GET http://<phone-ip>:4534/
```

and receive a live JSON snapshot updated every second:

```json
{
  "satName": "ISS (ZARYA)",
  "azimuthDeg": 247.35,
  "elevationDeg": 12.84,
  "altitudeKm": 421.10,
  "txFrequencyHz": 145827340,
  "rxFrequencyHz": 145826100,
  "ctcssTxToneHz": 67.0,
  "ctcsRxToneHz": null,
  "mode": "FM",
  "aosTime": 1752012345000,
  "losTime": 1752012945000,
  ...
}
```

Full field reference, idle state semantics, and versioning rules are documented in [SATLIB.md](SATLIB.md).
